# Core Concept of ReactJS

- Always captilize first letter of component file name, its function name also.
- Also some library will ask you to put file extension as ".jsx" like "vite".
- React Native works with mobile apps. React-Dom works for website.


- Any code written in JSX return() context. And data wrapped in curly braces {} is called "evaluated expression". e.g., {username}
- Meaning that code is final result of business logic.
- Any business logic code (like if-else, loops etc.) must be written outside the return() context. (01basicvite - App.jsx)
