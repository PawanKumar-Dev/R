- When we create normal counter with classic JS concept. We see our variable is updated. But in UI updated data is not shown. This happens becoz all UI changes are controlled by React itself. (03counterhook - App.jsx)

- When you use "useState", you're telling React to remember a piece of data (the state) and automatically re-render the component whenever that data changes.

- To updated data anywhere/everywhere in UI, we use "useState()" hook. Its a method where we can pass initial value of variable. For our case, 'counter' variable is used.  (03counterhook - AppTwo.jsx)
