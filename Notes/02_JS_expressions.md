# JavaScript Expression

- Evaluated expressions refer to JS expressions that are calculated and rendered within your JSX code.

- JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in your JS files and integrate dynamic data into your UI.

- Any code written in JSX return() context. And data wrapped in curly braces {} is called "evaluated expression". e.g., {username}

- Meaning that code is final result of business logic.

- Any business logic code (like if-else, loops etc.) must be written outside the return() context. (01basicvite - App.jsx)
