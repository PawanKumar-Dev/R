# Context API

- Built-in feature that facilitates the sharing of state or data across components without manually passing props through every level of component tree (prop drilling).

- Context API is best used for "global" data that many components need access to. Such as themes, user authentication, or language preferences.

- But context api get complex when in large apps. In such case, Redux-Toolkit is better solution.
