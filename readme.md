# ReactJS

- Always captilize first letter of component file name, its function name also.
- Also some library will ask you to put file extension as ".jsx" like "vite".

- React Native works with mobile apps. React-Dom works for website.

- Any code written in JSX return() context. And data wrapped in curly braces {} is "evaluvated expression". Meaning that code is final result. So any JS code (like if-else, loops) must be written outside the return() context.
